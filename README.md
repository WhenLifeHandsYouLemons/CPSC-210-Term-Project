# My Personal Project (project-g5n6b)
## Task 1
Potential ideas for my personal project:
- A book/word count tracker *(very personal)*
- A habit tracker *(NOT a to-do list, it's more geared for repeating reminders and tracking habit streaks, also very personal)*
- A simple budget tracker *(might be too simple and generic, but slightly personal)*

**Project decision:** A book/word count tracker

## Task 2
I've chosen to make a **book/word count tracker** application that will allow the user to enter many things such as:
- Book names
- Word/page counts
- Time they finished reading

They can also add specific books to certain user libraries which they could filter by and get statistics such as:
- Total words per library
- Average book length
- Average books per library
- Longest and shortest books

It could also include tags which could be filtered by and could have its own statistics. This application would work well as a console application and also as a GUI desktop application as I'll need to make it as both versions for the other phases of this project.

I think that my target audience would be mostly people who enjoy reading books a lot and would like to know about their reading history and habits as there could be visualisations about that information. This project is also something that interested me because I read a lot of books and there aren't many apps that show all of that information without having a paywall or just not having those statistics and features. I wanted to have an app that I could also use after the project finishes for my own personal use and also for other people to use.

## Task 3
### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a book to my reading history.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a library and add books to it.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the list of my reading history.
- As a user, I want to be able to add statistics such as word count, page count, and reading duration to the books in my library.
