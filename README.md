# My Personal Project (project-g5n6b)
## Task 1
Potential ideas for my personal project:
- A book/word count tracker (very personal)
- A habit tracker (NOT a to-do list, it's more geared for repeating reminders and tracking habit streaks, also very personal)
- A simple budget tracker (might be too simple and generic, but slightly personal)
- Cat desktop interactor thing (probably won't fulfil requirements but very personal)

**Final decision:** A book/word count tracker
