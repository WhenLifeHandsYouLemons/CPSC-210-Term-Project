# CPSC 210 Personal Project (project-g5n6b)
I've chosen to make a **book/word count tracker** application that will allow the user to enter many things such as:
- Book names
- Word/page counts
- Time they finished reading

They can also add specific books to certain user libraries which they could filter by and get statistics such as:
- Total words per library
- Average book length
- Average books per library
- Longest and shortest books

It could also include tags which could be filtered by and could have its own statistics. This application would work well as a console application and also as a GUI desktop application as I'll need to make it as both versions for the other phases of this project.

I think that my target audience would be mostly people who enjoy reading books a lot and would like to know about their reading history and habits as there could be visualisations about that information. This project is also something that interested me because I read a lot of books and there aren't many apps that show all of that information without having a paywall or just not having those statistics and features. I wanted to have an app that I could also use after the project finishes for my own personal use and also for other people to use.
